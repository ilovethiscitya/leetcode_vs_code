 * Hard (36.22%)
 * Total Accepted:    168K
 * Total Submissions: 451.2K
 * Testcase Example:  '"horse"\n"ros"'
 *
 * Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of operations
 * required to convert word1 to word2.
 * 
 * You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:
 * 
 * 
 * Insert a character
 * Delete a character
 * Replace a character
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: 
 * horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
 * rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
 * rose -> ros (remove 'e')
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: 
 * intention -> inention (remove 't')
 * inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
 * enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
 * exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
 * exection -> execution (insert 'u')
 *
